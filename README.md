# Simple Calculator

### calc.py
Using the RegEx module
calc.py is a simple calculator created using the RegEx module. It is another way to create a simple calculator. In this type, however, I have not included buttons for GUI. 

### calculator.py
Creating a calculator using Tkinter module in python3.8.2. If you get Tkinter ModuleError, install it by running:
sudo apt-get install python3.8-tk(Tkinter module for Python3) in ubuntu terminal. Make sure you install the right one based on your Python version. 
It will be nice if you run it in Pycharm IDE.
